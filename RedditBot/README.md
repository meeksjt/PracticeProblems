# Hangman
This is a program under the 'Practice Problems' project to play the classic game of Hangman.
This doesn't really need a makefile or virtual environment since it is such a simple project, but I wanted more practice
creating both.

## How to Run:

Execute the below commands to execute the program:
1. ```cd ``` into the 'Hangman' directory.
2. ```make freeze``` to write the library versions to the 'requirements.lock' file.
3. ```make test``` to run Hangman.
